/**
 * Rule objects are fairly abstract: the name of a rule and the dependencies of
 * a rule (which are themselves names) can be anything; and unfortunately, we
 * cannot really enforce names, or else it would mean we'd have to have a
 * `RuleName` type everywhere.
 *
 * This function exists to bridge that gap at the point where the rule is
 * actually defined by validating the name and dependencies against a known set
 * of rules.
 *
 * @param args - The arguments to this function.
 * @param args.name - The name of a rule. This function assumes that all rule
 * names are predefined in an enum and that this is one of the values in that
 * enum.
 * @param args.description - The description of the rule. This will show up when
 * listing rules as a part of the lint report for a project.
 * @param args.dependencies - The names of rules that must be executed first
 * before executing this one.
 * @param args.execute - The "body" of the rule.
 * @returns The (validated) rule.
